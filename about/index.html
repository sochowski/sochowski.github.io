<p>I&rsquo;m Aidan, a third year undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying computer science and statistics. I&rsquo;m originally from the Chicagoland area, I&rsquo;ve worked in multiple research groups on campus, and I&rsquo;ve previously done internships at AARP and Amazon. I&rsquo;m mainly interested in working with distributed systems, video, or computer vision, however I&rsquo;m open to most software engineering roles. I&rsquo;ll be looking for new grad software engineer roles once I graduate in May 2023.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve already completed all of my undergrad degree requirements, I am not planning on graduating until May 2023 and am currently taking a hiatus from my computer science coursework. After my fourth semester (spring 2021), I started to feel pretty burnt out from school. So, I decided to shift my focus for the entirety of 2022 away from schoolwork and towards trying to figure out how I want to spend my future. I landed two internships at Google and Twitch, for the winter and summer, respectively, and am going to be studying abroad in the fall, which I think all these experiences will help kick me out of feeling burnt out. I truly think I&rsquo;m doing this for the best of maximizing my learning, albeit in a non-academic environment. I&rsquo;m planning on somewhat resuming my computer science coursework while abroad, and taking some classes I&rsquo;m interested in the spring 2023 semester.</p>
<p>Outside of my school and work life, I&rsquo;m a coffee purist, a freak who spends too much money on his mechanical keyboard, and a full-time plant killer. I also really enjoy playing chess and rowing, and I&rsquo;ve been driving a 1995 Toyota Corolla since I&rsquo;ve learned to drive in 2016.</p>
