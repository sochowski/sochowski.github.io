      <description>Disclaimer: The title of this post is somewhat misleading, as I am still technically enrolled as a full-time student, but I am taking the absolute bare minimum amount to remain eligible for my scholarships that require me to stay a full-time student (I still don&amp;rsquo;t even understand the rules given I&amp;rsquo;d be saving the university money by not taking classes, but I digress). By no means am I saying that everyone should do this, however I think it&amp;rsquo;s the best decision for some people under some super specific conditions.</description>
